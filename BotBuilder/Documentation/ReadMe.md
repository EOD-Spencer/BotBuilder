## 📝 Description

>THANK YOU ❤️ for taking the time to check out this project.

I started this project as a fun way to learn more about Avalonia's Cross Platform MVVM model as well as software development in general.  Although this is a new project, it is greatly inspired by the out as a new Avalonia Cross Platform Application; its design and functionality are greatly inspired by [Peter Batchelor's](https://github.com/Pbatch) repository [ClashRoyaleBuildABot](https://github.com/Pbatch/ClashRoyaleBuildABot). If you find this project interesting, check out that project to 💥blow💥 your mind.
